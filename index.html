<!-- //* Play proceeds as follows:

  * The user arrives at the landing page and is presented with a call-to-action to "Start Quiz." Also note the navigation option to "View Highscores" and the "Time" value set at 0.
  User sees start button and option to view high scores and time should be zero

  * Clicking the "Start Quiz" button presents the user with a series of questions. The timer is initialized with a value and immediately begins countdown.
  when button is clicked button screen should change to show questions

  --jquery to manipulate the DOM
     --We will have divs to hold questions
    --Div will show question and corresponding answers (will do once start button is clicked)
    --These questions will come from javascript objects recomended in read me

  * Score is calculated by time remaining. Answering quickly and correctly results in a higher score. Answering incorrectly results in a time penalty (for example, 15 seconds are subtracted from time remaining).
TBA

  * When time runs out and/or all questions are answered, the user is presented with their final score and asked to enter their initials. Their final score and initials are then stored in `localStorage`.
  afterward click last question should see screen that says you're finished

* Your application should also be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

* Refer to the animated GIF below for a demonstration of the application functionality. -->
